.SH NAME
.B _printf
- Formatted output conversion.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.B int _printf(const char *
.I format
.B ,...)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _printf()
Prints to standard output under the control of a
.I format
string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output.
.SH Return value
.TP
On success, _printf returns the number of characters printed. If
.I format
is NULL or if the functions encounters any errors, it returns -1.
.TP
.B Format of the format string
.TP
he format string can contain any characters, just like a regular string, in double quotes, which will be printed as is. For example, _printf(\(dqHello\(dq) will print: Hello.
However, this format string can contain
.I conversion specifiers.
These start with a %, and are followed with a character (see
.I conversion specifiers
). Special characters like a new line are escaped, for example _printf(\(dq\\n\(dq) will print a new line.
.B Conversion specifiers
TP
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.BR c
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, then the resulting character is written
.TP
.B s
The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to a terminating null byte, but do ot include the terminating null byte.
.TP
.B S
Prints a string. Non printable characters are printed as "\x" followed by their ASCII values in two digit hexadecimal
.TP
.B d, i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B x, X
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned lowercase hexadecimal notation(x), or unsigned uppercase hexadecimal notation(X).
.TP
.B u
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned decimal notation
.TP
.B o, b
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal notation(o) or binary notation(b).
.TP
.B p
Address is printed in hexadecimal.
.TP
.B r
Prints a string in reverse.
.TP
.B R
Prints a string converted to rot13
.TP
.B %
A '%' is written but no argument is converted. The complete version specification is '%%'
.SH EXAMPLE
To print the day of the year, where weekday and month are pointers to strings and day and year are integers:

#include "main.h"

_printf("%s, %s %d, %d\\n", weekday, month, day, year);
